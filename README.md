### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my repository "Stix_Bundle_Creator".
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I can about Python.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that I find interesting and useful to the world.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with advice on what to learn next that is interesting in programming.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have many university degrees but none are in computer science.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about why I'm learning programming.
